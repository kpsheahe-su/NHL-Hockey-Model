Predictive Hockey Model 

The aim of this project is to effectively predict hockey outcomes using single-game data and determine if those findings are good enough to create an advantage in the betting market. Using python to scrape data from www.NaturalStattrick.com then stored in a local SQL database allows for a secure and reliable way of calling up the data when doing analysis. If you have any questions please feel free to email me at kpsheahe@syr.edu.
